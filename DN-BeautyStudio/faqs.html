            <h3 class="accordion-header">How long do lash extensions last?</h3>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>
                    The lifespan of lash extensions varies depending on factors such as your natural lash growth cycle and aftercare routine. Typically, they last between 4 to 6 weeks before requiring a touch-up. To maintain your lash extensions, avoid rubbing or pulling on them, refrain from using oil-based products around the eye area, and brush them daily with a clean lash wand to keep them looking neat and uniform.

            <h3 class="accordion-header">Can I wear makeup with lash extensions?</h3>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>
                    Yes, you can wear makeup with lash extensions, but it's important to use oil-free products and avoid using waterproof mascara, as it can weaken the adhesive bond and cause premature shedding of the extensions.

            <h3 class="accordion-header">How long does brow lamination last?</h3>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>
                    Brow lamination typically lasts between 4 to 6 weeks, depending on factors such as your skin type and aftercare routine. Regular touch-ups may be required to maintain the desired look.

            <h3 class="accordion-header">What is the difference between microblading and brow lamination?</h3>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>
                    Microblading is a semi-permanent tattooing technique used to enhance the shape and fullness of the brows, while brow lamination is a chemical process that smooths and sets the brow hairs in place, giving them a fuller, more defined appearance.

            <h3 class="accordion-header">Can I eat and drink normally after getting lip blush?</h3>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>
                    Yes, you can eat and drink normally after getting lip blush, but it's recommended to avoid hot, spicy, and acidic foods for the first few days to prevent irritation and promote healing.
                </p>

            <h3 class="accordion-header">How soon can I wear lipstick after getting lip blush?</h3>
            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>
                    It's best to wait at least 7 to 10 days before applying lipstick or other lip products to allow the pigment to fully settle and the lips to heal properly.
