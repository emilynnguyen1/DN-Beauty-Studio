                        <p>"My favorite lash artist! I have been to many different lash artists throughout the past two years and was never satisfied... until I met Dianna. Her studio is spotless, she is efficient and always on time. I always leave the studio with my lashes looking AMAZING. I am constantly getting complements about my lashes. She never rushes. I go back every 3 weeks and my lashes look like a full set. I cannot recommend dianna enough. I am so grateful to have found her. You will not regret your decision. Go see dianna!"</p>

                        <p>"Dianna is the absolute best in the business! I have been going to her for my lash extensions for over a year now and she always does a fabulous job. She listens to what I want and the look I'm trying to achieve and always does a perfect job. Dianna is professional, always on time, flexible and as sweet as can be! I also just had her do my eyebrows--micro blading and powder brows--they look amazing. She just keeps getting better and better. I love my new brows. They are incredible. I'd never trust anyone else with my lashes or my brows. I will forever be a client of Dianna's. She is truly the very best at her artistry. I love her!!!"</p>

                        <p>"If you don't want to waste money then go to Dianna! I've been getting my lashes done by Dianna for about 8 months now and she consistently does a great job. She takes her time and makes sure that you love your results. My lashes always last for a long time and she doesn't mess up your real lashes, which is important!! Her work room is super cute and clean too. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!! Your lashes will thank me."</p>

Her attention to detail really sets her apart from everyone else in the industry. If you're looking for someone who listens to you, is aware of your style, is BEYOND talented. Then you've found your person! Couldn't be happier!"</p>

                        <p>"Dianna did an amazing job on my eye brows! It was my first time getting them done and will never regret it. I freaked out on the peeling and how light they got, but she took the time to explained the whole process/stages to me. Thank You Dianna for giving me the confidence on my eyebrows. My makeup went from 1.5hr to 30 minutes even less. I love them"</p>
